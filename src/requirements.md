# Motivation
Creating the #1 application for weather advisory where people from all other the US 
can get up-to-date information about alerts & advisories in their area.

# MVP
- Users need to be able to select their state
- Users need to be able to see the corresponding alerts for the selected state
- The application must use the National Weather Service API to retrieve the alerts
- Users need to see the headline & description of an alert

# Extended features
- Make it look nice
- Users need to be able to filter the alerts by alert type
- Alerts need to be sorted from most recent alert to past alerts
- Users need to be able to see instructions for the corresponding alert
- Users need to be able to see if an alert is currently active, how long it 
has been effective and when it will end
